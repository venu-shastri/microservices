## Elastic Search
Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time. It is generally used as the underlying engine/technology that powers applications that have complex search features and requirements.
### Elastic Search Basic Concepts
- **Near Real-time (NRT):** near real-time search platform means that exist a slight latency (normally one second) from the time you index a document until the time it becomes searchable.
- **Cluster:** is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.
